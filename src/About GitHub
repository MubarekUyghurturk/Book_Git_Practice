 How to create local repo by using terminal in Mac?
 1) go to project, right click project and copy absolute path of project.
 2) open terminal, type ---> cd (paste copy) and enter
 3) git init ===> created
 4) git add . ===> your code will be in staging area.
 5) git commit -m"write your commit here"


 When we wanna track our project:
 1) git init === create git repository (one time only)
 2) git add. === add the changes to staging area
 3) git commit -m"massage" === commit the changes into git repo with message

 git lod === is for check commit history (for escape --> type q or wq)
 git status === is for check which step we are at
